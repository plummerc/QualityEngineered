<h3 id="ra">Requirements Analysis</h3>
    <p>     In this phase, testers analyze the customer requirements and work with developers during the design phase 
        to see which requirements are testable and how they are going to test those requirements.
<br>
            It is very important to start testing activities from the requirement phase itself, because the cost of 
            fixing bugs is significantly reduced if they are found in the requirements phase.</p>
<hr>
<h3 id="tp">Test Planning</h3>
    <p>     In this phase, testers are typically finding answers to the following questions:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>What are the risks being mitigated by testing?</li>
                    <li>What needs to be tested?</li>
                    <li>How will testing be done?</li>
                    <li>What test strategy will be followed?</li>
                    <li>What will be the testing environment?</li>
                    <li>Which test methodologies will be followed?</li>
                    <li>What hardware and software will be used and how will it be used?</li>
                    <li>What test documentation will be required- See IEEE 829 for more detail on this?</li>
                </ul>

<h3 id="td">Test Case Development</h3>  
    <p>There are two main components of Test Case Development:    </p>
        <dl>
            <dt>Test Analysis</dt>
            <dd>After test planning is over test analysis phase starts, in this phase we need to dig deeper into project
                 and figure out what testing needs to be carried out in each SDLC phase. Automation activities are also 
                 decided in this phase, if automation needs to be done, how much time will it take to automate and which
                  features need to be automated.</dd>
            <dt>Test Design</dt>
            <dd>In this phase various black box and white box testing designs are used to design the test cases for testing,
                 testers start writing test cases by following those design techniques. If automation testing needs to be 
                 done, then automation scripts are written in this phase.</dd>
                 </dl>
<hr>


<h3 id="es">Environment Setup</h3>  
    <p>There are two main components of Environment Setup:</p>
            <dl>
                <dt>Test Construction and Verification</dt>
                <dd>In this case testers prepare more test cases by keeping in mind the positive and negative scenarios, end 
                    user scenarios, etc. All test cases and automation scripts needs to be completed in this phase. A Test 
                    document plan should be finalized and must be verified by key stakeholders.</dd>
                <dt>Data Setup</dt>
                <dd>Testers create necessary data to execute test cases, preparing for prerequisites defined in the test 
                    planning phase</dd>
                    </dl>
<hr>    


<h3 id="te">Test Execution and Bug Reporting</h3>  
    <p>     Once unit testing is completed by the developers, the build is delivered to the test team and test cases are
         executed. Bugs are reported during test execution. As developers fix the bugs found, testers re-test and perform 
         regression testing to ensure that the bugs are resolved and that the fixes did not affect any other areas of the 
         software. Test execution reports are created and circulated to the project stakeholders. </p>     
    <p>
            After the tester ensures that no more critical bugs remain in the software, the build is delivered to a production 
            mirror environment for a final round of testing. In this phase, the final testing is done for the software, 
            non-functional testing like stress, load and performance testing are performed in this phase. End users also 
            are given a chance to create a test plan to execute cases through their familiar business scenarios to achieve a wider
            breadth of testing and feedback.
        </p>
<hr>

<h3 id="tc">Test Cycle Closure</h3>  
    <p>     In this phase, the test and production mirror environments are cleaned and restored to default state, a process 
        review meeting is held and lessons learned are documented for the purpose of continuous improvement.</p>
